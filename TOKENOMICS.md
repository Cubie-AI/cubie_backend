$CUBIE TOKEN: 2MH8ga3TuLvuvX2GUtVRS2BS8B9ujZo3bj5QeAkMpump
DAO: EKRo46r9hTkSgRdcGBTXWvkJTpF94DGb9tbtQUVvHH9S


On the cubie platform launching an agent comes at a fixed sol cost.
This price increases 0.5% per agent launched.


The allocation is then used in the following way:

The price increases 0.5% per agent launched up to some practical limit

- 50% is used to buy $CUBIE 
- 30% is used to $MAIAR
- 20% is left in SOL

This is then further allocated:
- 50% of the 50% of $CUBIE is burnt 
- 40% of the $CUBIE (equal to the 20% sol) is added to the LP 

The remaining 10% of $CUBIE and all of the $MAIAR is sent to the  $CUBIE DAO for:
- Agent to user airdrops 
- Development bounties on $MAIAR framework and CUBIE platform
- Platform exprenses 


=> DAO will be voted on by $CUBIE holders come some date.
